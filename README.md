# Steady SASS

Welcome to Steady SASS, my personal starter kit for all side projects and client projects. This repository serves as a showcase of my ideal project setup, continually updated with the latest improvements from my various projects.

I welcome input and feedback on the stack, code quality, testing practices, and the services utilizedâ€”however, I retain the final say; changes may not always be accepted.

- [ ] Find and replace `steadysass` with the slug of your project. This will replace most occurrences of package names.
- [ ] Replace the favicon in `apps/app/favicon.ico`.
- [ ] Fill out .env file in the root of the project
